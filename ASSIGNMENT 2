This assignment doesn't require code, but since you asked for “code,” I’ll present the data structure and prompt in a developer-friendly format using JavaScript-style pseudocode + a structured prompt that you could pass into an AI model for smart brainstorming.

✅ Part 1: 7 Key Data Points for Personalized Retreat Recommendation Engine
We want to make recommendations based on a holistic understanding of the user. Here are 7 essential data points:

const userProfile = {
  interests: ['meditation', 'hiking', 'yoga'],
  wellnessGoals: ['stress relief', 'better sleep', 'detox'],
  preferredClimate: 'cool mountain air',
  desiredRetreatType: 'solo or group',
  duration: '3-5 days',
  budgetRange: '₹10,000 - ₹25,000',
  opennessToDigitalDetox: true
};
Explanation of Each Data Point:
Interests – Activities or experiences the user enjoys (e.g., yoga, journaling, art).

Wellness Goals – What the user wants to achieve (e.g., stress relief, mindfulness).

Preferred Climate/Environment – E.g., beach, mountains, forest, desert.

Retreat Type – Solo retreat, couples retreat, group community, etc.

Retreat Duration – Time user can commit: weekend, 1 week, 10+ days.

Budget Range – Determines feasible retreat options.

Openness to Digital Detox – Helps match retreats with tech-free or tech-enabled options.

✅ Part 2: Prompt Engineering Example
Let’s pick "Interests" as our AI-augmented data point.

🎯 GOAL:
We want an AI to help brainstorm a categorized, user-friendly list of retreat-relevant interests that we can show in a form (checkboxes, autocomplete, etc.)

💡 AI Prompt:

Edit
You're helping design a user onboarding flow for a wellness retreat platform. 
I need you to generate a clean, categorized list of user interests specifically related to retreat preferences. 
Group them into 5-6 meaningful categories (like 'Physical Activities', 'Mindfulness Practices', 'Creative Hobbies', etc.). 
Each category should contain 4–6 specific interests that are relevant to retreats. 
Avoid overly niche items; make sure these are general enough for most users to understand and relate to. 
Please return the data in a clean, JSON-style structure suitable for frontend use (e.g., dropdown or checkboxes).
✅ Why This Prompt Works:
It defines the use case (onboarding flow for retreat app).

It specifies the output format (JSON-style list).

It gives guidance on structure (categories + items).

It adds constraints (not too niche, easy to relate).

It’s specific enough to avoid generic, useless output.

✨ Sample Output from AI (Based on That Prompt)

{
  "Physical Activities": ["Hiking", "Yoga", "Swimming", "Nature Walks"],
  "Mindfulness Practices": ["Meditation", "Breathwork", "Sound Healing", "Tai Chi"],
  "Creative Hobbies": ["Painting", "Writing", "Photography", "Pottery"],
  "Healing Therapies": ["Ayurveda", "Massage Therapy", "Reiki", "Aromatherapy"],
  "Spiritual Growth": ["Chakra Balancing", "Mantra Chanting", "Silent Retreat", "Energy Healing"]
}
✅ Summary
You demonstrated:

Strategic thinking in choosing key personalization variables.

Prompt engineering by crafting a targeted query for an AI model.

Data modeling using code-style structures for developer integration.
